          <p>I‚Äôve always loved doing the sudoku.</p>

          <p>It started in the summer of 2015. I was a senior in high school and had just started the college application process. Like many teenagers, I signed up for the SAT. Like many teenagers, I compiled a list of safety and target schools. And, like many teenagers, I was beginning to panic about acceptances.</p>

          <p>One particular afternoon, I found myself down a rabbit hole full of self doubt and insecurity. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt smart enough, or my grades would pull down my application, or that my essays wouldn‚Äôt stand out.</p>

          <p>I needed to challenge this voice in my head. I knew I was smart and capable (or so I thought). I looked around for a way to prove it and saw the Sunday newspaper on the coffee table in front of me, open to the puzzles page. I told myself if I could solve that day‚Äôs sudoku, I could prove to myself that I had what it takes to get acceptances. I solved that sudoku and haven‚Äôt stopped doing it since.</p>

          <p>I got so into the puzzle in high school, I completed 100 sudokus in 100 consecutive days. I‚Äôd take our newspaper‚Äôs puzzles page to school and solve it during class. A classmate once said while most students had their phones out under their desks, I had the sudoku. When I moved to the US for college, I bought a book full of puzzles. I was crazy about it.</p>

          <p>And then I stopped doing it just as quickly as I had started.</p>

          <p>In October 2020, a girl I liked texted me: ‚ÄúDo u wanna have a sudoku race üëâü•∫üëà‚Äù</p>

          <p>We solved that day‚Äôs New York Times‚Äô easy puzzle and <code>xx</code> sudokus since then to see who could complete it first.</p>

          <p>We even started a spreadsheet to track our times. Our competitive natures pushed us to challenge each other almost daily. Like in high school, I was constantly thinking about how to get faster.</p>

          <p>Then, in January 2023, I made a breakthrough. I started tracking what grids I fill out and how I fill them out. And in the weeks since, I started to analyze my performance to look for patterns and ways I could speed up. As a throwback to my high school self, I decided to analyze 100 sudokus to see what I could learn. This essay has a few insights I‚Äôve found.</p>
          
          <h4>Patterns</h4>
          <p>Like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-man-who-solved-jeopardy/#:~:text=One%20possible%20explanation%20for%20the%20increased%20likelihood%20that%20respondents%20will%20pick%20a%20Daily%20Double%20earlier%20is%20that%20the%20placement%20of%20the%20clues%20aren%E2%80%99t%20random%2C%20which%20informs%20this%20hopping%20strategy.">Jeopardy! and its daily doubles</a>, the Times‚Äô sudoku grids tend to have the same cells prefilled. On average, the easy sudoku comes with xx values prefilled.</p>

          <span style="color:red">Still working on getting legends to work...</span>

          <!-- <div class="radio-toggles">
            <input type="radio" id="easy" value="Easy" onclick="setPreDiff(easy)" checked />
            <label for="easy">Easy</label>

            <input type="radio" id="medium" value="Medium" onclick="setPreDiff(med)"/>
            <label for="medium">Medium</label>

            <input type="radio" id="hard" value="Hard" onclick="setPreDiff(hard)"/>
            <label for="hard">Hard</label>

            <div class="highlight"></div>
          </div> -->

          <div id="radioToggles"></div>
          <div id="prefilledGrid"></div>
          <p class="caption" style="margin: -1rem 0 2rem;">Data above is from xxx Times sudokus. Hover over each cell above to see how often it came prefilled.</p>

          <h4>Let's start with my strategy</h4>
          <p>When I first see a sudoku grid, my instinct is to look for naked singles. Naked singles are cells where <b>there can only be one possible value</b>. (They‚Äôre also called sole candidates, but why would you call them that when you could say naked singles? I digress.)</p>

          <img src="assets/slice_dice.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a sudoku grid with one cell highlighted" />
          <p class="caption">In the NYTimes grid above, only the number 8 can be played in the highlighted cell.</p>

          <p>Using the process of elimination, I identify naked singles and solve those cells. I only ever fill in a value when it‚Äôs a naked single, i.e., I never guess. So when I fill out the grid, I almost never redo cells once I fill them. This is a tradition I‚Äôve digitized ‚Äî high school me would fill out grids with a pen.</p>

          <p>As you solve each cell in the sudoku, you eliminate possible values throughout the grid. For example, putting a 5 in one cell means you can‚Äôt play a 5 anywhere else in that row, column, or section. In the process of filling out cells, you create more naked singles.</p>

          <p>Essentially, by getting the numbers of these naked singles, you're introduced to their other naked single friends.</p>

          <p>And this is a great way to analyze my performance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <div class="col-lg-10">
            <div id="scrollySingles" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Why do I tend to take longer in the middle and towards the end? I have a feeling it has something to do with <i>order</i> in which I fill out the cells. Let's talk about that.</p>

            <span style="color: red;">The next section will be a scrollytelling section walking through how I fill out my grids. The main takeaway is I always start toward the top (bc high density of prefilled cells), then the middle section, then the bottom -- which is why I spend longer on those sections.</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-md-10">
            <img src="assets/string_of_pearls.jpg" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <div id="section-break-2"></div>
            <p>Crazy as it may sound, I‚Äôm not as into the sudoku now as much as when I was in high school. While I still try to solve the puzzle once a day, teenage me would always have a grid on his person.</p>

            <p>I started this project with the intention to use analytics to find patterns in how I solve the sudoku. A huge takeaway is the way I move through the grid. I could further analyze my data to see where I make mistakes; if certain types of grids trip me up (<a href="https://github.com/vivrao9/nyt-sudoku/blob/master/data-analysis/matrix-similarity.ipynb" target="_blank">preliminary analysis</a> says the grids themselves don't have much in common), or; if there are certain numbers I fill out first.</p>

            <p>But in the journey, I learned that each puzzle was as unique as each day ‚Äî each puzzle warrants a different perspective. Maybe I solved a puzzle faster than expected because I was excited, or maybe I missed a naked single because I was distracted.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, as much as I‚Äôve loved working on this puzzle, another limitation is I could only fill it out on my laptop (see methodology) and not my phone. As a result, I actually solved the sudoku less often than before I started tracking my data.</p>

            <p>Maybe the biggest takeaway is to not measure everything and be in the moment?</p>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p>I created a JavaScript browser extension on my laptop to track how I filled out the Times‚Äô easy sudoku grid and then send this data to a server running on my Raspberry Pi. I used Jupyter notebooks to analyze my performance, and React + D3 to visualize the data on this page.</p>

            <p>Check out my work on this project <a href="https://github.com/vivrao9/nyt-sudoku" target="_blank">here</a> or my portfolio <a href="https://vivrao9.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to use the extension to analyze your performance ‚Äî it only works on the NYT website, but can be edited to work on other websites too.</p>
