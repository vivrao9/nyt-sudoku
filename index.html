I was a senior in high school and had just started the college application process. Like many teenagers, I signed up for the SAT. Like many teenagers, I compiled a list of safety and target schools. And, like many teenagers, I was beginning to panic about acceptances.</p><p>One particular afternoon, I found myself down a rabbit hole full of self doubt and insecurity. I felt like I wasn’t smart enough, or my grades would pull down my application, or that my essays wouldn’t stand out.</p><p>I needed to challenge this voice in my head. I knew I was smart and capable (or so I thought). I looked around for a way to prove it and saw the Sunday newspaper on the coffee table in front of me, open to the puzzles page. I told myself if I could solve that day’s sudoku, I could prove to myself that I had what it takes to get acceptances. I solved that sudoku and haven’t stopped doing it since.</p><p>I loved that I could take things one puzzle at a time, and every puzzle, one cell at a time. The puzzle served as a constant to the ups and downs of everyday life.</p><p>I got so into the puzzle in high school, I completed 100 sudokus in 100 consecutive days. I’d take our newspaper’s puzzles page to school and solve it during class. A classmate once said while most students had their phones out under their desks, I had the sudoku. When I moved to the US for college, I bought a book full of puzzles. I was crazy about it.</p><p>And then I stopped doing it just as quickly as I had started.</p><div id="section-break-1"></div></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><p>In October 2020, a friend texted me: “Do u wanna have a sudoku race 👉🥺👈”</p><p>We solved that day’s New York Times’ easy puzzle and hundreds of sudokus since then to see who could complete it first.</p><p>We even started a spreadsheet to track our times. Our competitive natures pushed us to challenge each other almost daily. Like in high school, I was constantly thinking about how to get faster.</p><div id="histogram" alt="This space contains a histogram chart where each square represents one completed sudoku. The dots are arranged in order of how long I took to complete that sudoku."></div><p>Then, in January 2023, I made a breakthrough. I started tracking what grids I fill out and how I fill them out<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. And in the weeks since, I started to analyze my performance to look for patterns and ways I could speed up. As a throwback to my high school self, I decided to analyze from 100 <b>Easy</b> sudokus to see what I could learn. This essay has a few insights I’ve found.</p><h4>Let's start with my strategy</h4><p>When I first see a sudoku grid, my instinct is to look for naked singles. Naked singles are cells where <b>there can be only one possible value</b>. They're the slam dunks. No-brainers. Easy pickings. (They’re also called sole candidates, but why would you call them that when you could say naked singles? I digress.)</p><img src="assets/naked-single-explainer.gif" alt="An animating GIF of a sudoku grid with a cell highlighted. As different values are entered in that cell, the grid lights up to indicate that that value is incorrect."/><p class="caption">In the NYTimes grid above, only the number 9 can be played in the highlighted cell.</p><p>Using the process of elimination, I identify naked singles and solve those cells. I only ever fill in a value when it’s a naked single, i.e., I never guess. So when I fill out the grid, I almost never redo cells once I fill them. This is a tradition I’ve digitized — high school me would fill out grids with a pen.</p><p>As you solve each cell in the sudoku, you eliminate possible values throughout the grid. For example, putting a 5 in one cell means you can’t play a 5 anywhere else in that row, column, or section. In the process of filling out cells, you create more naked singles.</p><p>Essentially, by getting the numbers of these naked singles, you're introduced to their other naked single friends.</p><p>And this is a great way to analyze my performance.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center" style="margin-top:1rem"><div class="col-lg-10"><div id="scrollySingles" style="display:flex;flex-direction:column"></div></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center" style="margin-top:1rem"><div class="col-md-6"><p>Based on the analysis above, I quickly solve cells that are towards the top, then take longer to fill out cells that are in the middle and bottom.</p><p>Why do I tend to take longer in these areas? I think it has something to do with how the cells come prefilled. Let's talk about that.</p><h4>Patterns</h4><p>Like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-man-who-solved-jeopardy/#:~:text=One%20possible%20explanation%20for%20the%20increased%20likelihood%20that%20respondents%20will%20pick%20a%20Daily%20Double%20earlier%20is%20that%20the%20placement%20of%20the%20clues%20aren%E2%80%99t%20random%2C%20which%20informs%20this%20hopping%20strategy.">Jeopardy! and its daily doubles</a>, the Times’ sudoku grids tend to have the same cells prefilled. On average, the easy sudoku comes with xx values prefilled.</p><div id="radioToggles"></div><div id="prefilledGrid"></div><p class="caption" style="margin:-1rem 0 2rem">Data above is from xxx Times sudokus. Hover over each cell above to see how often it came prefilled.</p><p>From the grid above, we see that the typical NYT easy sudoku has more prefilled cells towards the top. This makes it easier to start from the top. In fact, of the 100 sudokus I've collected data for, my first move is in the top three rows in xx of them.</p><p>The higher density of cells also makes it easier for my next strategy: <i>slicing and dicing</i>. Slicing and dicing is a common maneuver where, once you find a blank cell, you quickly scan its row and its column to see what numbers that cell <i>can't</i> be. In fact, in the primer on naked singles above, you could solve the empty cell by slicing and dicing, rather than cycling through all nine numbers.</p><p style="color:red">Maybe an animation/image of slicing and dicing.</p><p>Taken together, slicing and dicing and looking for naked singles are my primary strategy when solving the sudoku. I also look for something called hidden singles, but those are much harder to analyze. If you’re curious about them, read up <a href="https://www.learn-sudoku.com/hidden-singles.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>We've talked about my strategy and the how the grids tend to come prefilled. When you add those two together, how do I tend to move through the grid? Let's take a look at the way I move through the puzzle.</p><h4>Speed within a puzzle<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></h4><p>Once I identify a naked single, how long do I last before I finish, i.e., solve that cell? Let’s visualize every cell again, this time coloring based on how long it took me to fill them out.</p><p>In the graphic below, each column is one puzzle I’ve solved, and each cell within that column represents a cell I’ve filled out for that puzzle. Some puzzles have more cells filled out because:</p><ol><li>I made mistakes, or</li><li>the puzzle came prefilled with fewer cells.</li></ol><p></p></div></div><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-12"><div id="stringOfTimes"></div></div></div><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><p>The chart above reinforces our insight from above: I tend to start off strong, and then slow down towards the middle.</p><p>But wait. According to the chart above, there's more nuance. The lower half represents the final steps of solving a puzzle. And just before I finish each puzzle, it looks like I speed through the last few cells. This would make sense since there are fewer candidates towards the end.</p><p>In a future article, it could be interesting to segment and cluster puzzles based on my speed throughout them. For example, group together puzzles where I’m slow at the start, fast towards the middle, and slow at the end. This could reveal similarities between puzzles and their difficulties.</p><h4>Do I stick to some numbers more than others?</h4><p>Even though there are 10 basic digits that all numbers are made of, they’re not always uniform. Benford’s Law, for example, says that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-benfords-law-why-this-unexpected-pattern-of-numbers-is-everywhere/" target="_blank">leading digit in numbers is typically small.</a></p><div id="firstPlay" alt="This space contains a bar chart where each square represents one completed sudoku. More than 30% of my sudokus began with the number one."></div><p>From the chart above, I tend to start with the number “1” most of the time. While it isn't close to Benford's Law, it's still skewed towards smaller numbers. In fact, in the 84 sudokus I have data for<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, I started with the number “1” for 32 of them.</p><p>Is it because the first three rows typically have the number 1 prefilled? Not really. 1s are no less often to be prefilled than 8s. Or 3s, for that matter. Then why do I always start with the number 1?</p><p>Upon reflection, I feel like smaller numbers are easier to remember. When I solve the grid, sometimes I think “This cell can be a 5 or 6. Let me come back to this later.” I’ve noticed that when the numbers tend to be larger, it’s harder for me to remember them, despite still being under 10. I can’t explain why this is, but I’d be surprised if other people felt this way too.</p><p>This could be an interesting way for me to get faster. For future puzzles, I can write down potential candidates in the cell. The Times website allows players to play in Candidate mode — maybe I should use this feature more.</p><p>It might even be worth <b>diversifying my opening move</b>. I overwhelmingly start solving the grid by playing the number 1 in the first three rows.</p><img src="./assets/duolingo.png" alt="An image of the Duolingo owl saying “Let's review your mistakes!”"/><h4>Mistakes</h4><p>Is there a pattern with when I make mistakes? Let’s highlight all my mistakes, i.e., cells that I filled out more than once.</p><p style="color:red">Need to update scale on chart below.</p></div></div><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-12"><div id="stringOfMistakes"></div></div></div><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><p>It looks like I’m more likely to make mistakes when I’m almost done solving a puzzle. This is most likely because I get impatient. Sometimes I also guess because it’s faster than slicing and dicing.</p><p><b>I made a mistake in 65% of the puzzles I solved.</b> It’s not only important to make fewer mistakes, but also reduce the amount of time it takes to correct them. When I make a mistake, on average, it sets me back 5.1 seconds. Here’s a distribution of how long I spent correcting mistakes.</p><div id="distMistakeTime" alt="This space contains a histogram showing the distribution of times I took me to correct a mistake. The median time to correction is xxx."></div><div id="section-break-2"></div><p>Crazy as it may sound, I’m not as into the sudoku now as much as when I was a teenager. While I still try to solve the puzzle once a day, teenage me would always have a grid on his person.</p><p>While it’s cool to track and analyze your data as you solve the sudoku, it’s also important to be present as you solve the puzzle. And something the data doesn’t show is that since my first puzzle, the main message has remained the same: whatever life throws at you, take it one puzzle at a time, and one cell at a time.</p><h4>Methodology</h4><p>I wrote a JavaScript browser extension to track how I filled out the Times’ easy sudoku grid. I filled out 100 sudokus and had my data sent to a server running on my Raspberry Pi. I used Jupyter notebooks to analyze my performance and React + D3 to visualize the data.</p><p>Check out my work on this project <a href="https://github.com/vivrao9/nyt-sudoku" target="_blank">here</a> or my portfolio <a href="https://vivrao9.github.io/" target="_blank">here.</a> Feel free to use the extension to analyze your performance — it only works on the NYT website, but can be edited to work on other websites too.</p><p>Lastly, please reach out if you have tips on getting faster!</p><div class="footnotes"><p class="footnotesTitle">Notes on data collection</p><p><sup id="fn1">1</sup><b>Desktop: </b>To standardize data collection, I only filled out the sudoku from my laptop and not on my phone.
